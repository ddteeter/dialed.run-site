/**
 * dialed.run — motion tokens (single source of truth)
 *
 * THE POSITION
 * ------------
 * Motion is confirmation, not decoration. Every animation in dialed.run answers
 * one question — "did that register?" — and then gets out of the way.
 *
 * THREE LAWS
 * 1. THINGS ARRIVE, THEY DON'T SETTLE.  No bounce, no spring, no overshoot.
 *    Wobble is the opposite of dialed. Curves decelerate to a dead stop.
 * 2. THE BRACKET DOES THE WORK.  Reveals, commits and waits are expressed by
 *    the brand brackets closing, opening or breathing — not by fades and slides.
 * 3. NOTHING TRAVELS FAR.  Max 24px for an element, one bracket width for a
 *    frame. Containers may travel their own height. Nothing crosses the screen.
 *
 * CONTRACT FOR AGENTS
 * Import DURATION and EASING. Never type a raw ms value or cubic-bezier into a
 * screen. If a move needs a duration that isn't here, it's the wrong move.

/**
 * Navigation — screen-to-screen. Round 12.
 * One law: every navigation has a direction, and the direction is the transition.
 * Forward comes from the trailing edge; back leaves the way it came; a flow rises
 * from the bar and drops back to it; a swap into a pane has no direction and so
 * gets no travel. Five types. A screen that isn't reached by one of these isn't reachable.
 *
 * Ownership: NAV lists every shipped edge, not just the Flow Map's. A lane meeting a new
 * edge assigns a type by analogy to the nearest row, adds the row here in the same PR,
 * and flags it. Design reviews the row, not the release.
