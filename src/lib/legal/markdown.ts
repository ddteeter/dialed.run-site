 *
 * The legal texts' markdown, read into blocks a reading page renders
 * (task 126, ACC-13; round 28 PR A).
 *
 * **A real parser, and a closed set of what the page draws.** The text is
 * read by `mdast-util-from-markdown` with GFM's table extension, and the
 * tree is mapped onto the page's own `Block`/`Inline` types: a `#` title,
 * `##` and `###` headings, paragraphs, bulleted and numbered lists, tables,
 * block quotes, and inline bold, code and links. **Anything else throws**,
 * naming the construct and its line — emphasis, an image, a code block, a
 * fourth heading level, a nested list — so a construct the owner adds to a
 * file in `docs/legal/` fails the test that parses every one of them,
 * rather than reaching the page as something it cannot draw. The parser
 * this replaced read anything it did not know as text, and merged a
 * numbered list into one paragraph.
 *
 * Build time only here: the blocks are what reach the page, never the text
 * or the library.
